                <p>The last viable remnant of Sri Lanka's tropical lowland rainforest, the Sinharaja Rainforest is located in the Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces of the southwestern lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka. The total area of ​​Sinharaja Reserve is 18,900 acres or 7,648 hectares. It ranges in height from 300 meters to 1,170 meters. Sinharajaya is bounded by rivers on three sides. In the north, Sinharajaya is bounded by the Napola Valley and the Koskulana River. To the south and south-west are the Maha Dola and Ging Ganges. To the west is the Kalukandawa Canal and the Little River. An ancient footpath near the Beverley Tea Estate east of Sinharaja and near Mount Danuwa. Weather records collected in and around Sinharaja for the past 60 years reveal that the annual rainfall in Sinharaja forest ranges from 3614 to 5006 mm and temperature ranges from 19°C to 34°C. Two monsoons account for most of the rainfall: the Southwest Monsoon May–July and the Northeast Monsoon November–January.
                    <br><br> The two main nature trails in the Sinharaja Rainforest are the ones to the summit of Maulawella and the summit of Sinhagala. Both these nature trails start from Kunda Conservation Center (KCC). The forest is populated by tall trees growing close by, but winding trails lead to hill climbs. Small streams of crystal-clear cool water, home to a variety of fish, toads and crabs, meander through the trails. And mixed birds are found in the forest canopy. 19 of the 20 species of birds endemic to Sri Lanka are found in Sinharaja. Many species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and butterflies including the leopard are found in the reserve. The inbreeding between mammals and butterflies is more than 50%.</p>
